# Rust bindings to *nix APIs

Rust friendly bindings to various *nix platform APIs (Linux, Darwin,
...). The goal is to not provide a 100% unified interface, but try as
possible as well as providing platform specific APIs. It is up to the
consumer of this library to decide how portable they want to be.

This is very much a work in progress and I'm mostly just adding bindings
as I need them.

Of course, PRs welcome :)
